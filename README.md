## 4. Limitations

While Gemini can now create a wide variety of images, we are still working on improving key functionalities.  

- **Fact Statement**  
  Not every image generated by Gemini is perfect. The model may still struggle with:  
  - Detecting very small faces  
  - Producing accurate spelling in text  
  - Rendering extremely fine details in images  

- **Character Consistency**  
  The model performs strongly in maintaining consistency, but is not always 100% reliable.  
  - Characters may show slight variations across different prompts or scenes  
  - Long multi-turn editing chains may lead to minor drift in consistency  

We are continuously improving these areas to enhance reliability and user experience.
